<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Fire Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrical Actuators Type</li><li>Manual Actuators Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Marine Fire Damper market is categorized into two primary actuator types: electrical actuators and manual actuators. Electrical actuators operate automatically, using electrical signals to control the damper's position, ensuring rapid response during fire incidents. They are favored for their reliability and integration with onboard fire safety systems. In contrast, manual actuators require personnel intervention to operate the damper, offering a cost-effective solution, especially in smaller vessels where automation may not be necessary. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing marine safety.</p></p>
