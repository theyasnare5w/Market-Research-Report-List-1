<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Human Monoclonal Antibody</li><li>Humanized Monoclonal Antibody</li><li>Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody</li><li>Murine Monoclonal Antibody</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Monoclonal antibody therapy is categorized based on the origin and structure of the antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies are fully derived from human sources, offering reduced immune response. Humanized monoclonal antibodies are primarily human but retain small portions from other species, minimizing adverse reactions. Chimeric monoclonal antibodies combine human and murine elements, targeting specific diseases effectively. Murine monoclonal antibodies originate entirely from mice, useful in research but often elicit stronger immune responses. Each type serves distinct therapeutic applications and patient responses.</p></p>
